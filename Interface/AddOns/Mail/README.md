# Mail - WoW 1.12 addOn

An extension to the Blizzard mail interface which
- **Automatically opens mail, very rapidly**
- **Mails multiple items at once, very rapidly**
- **Autocompletes recipient names**

**\<Right Click>** on inbox items to loot the gold, loot the item and destroy the letter, in that order, if any.<br/>
**\<Right Click>** or **\<Left Drag>** to add inventory items to the attachments.<br/>
**\<Right Click>** to add inventory items to the trade frame.

Note that due to limitations of the 1.12 API, behind the scenes, the items must be sent in separate mails.<br/>
As a result of this **COD will only apply to the first item** if multiple items are added.

Also note that COD is always ignored when opening, both automatically as well as by **\<Right Click>**.
