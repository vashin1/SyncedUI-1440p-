# crafty - WoW 1.12 addOn 

Crafty adds a **fuzzy name search** to the default profession frames. Search results update on the fly and the first result (best match) is selected automatically.

It further adds an **availability filter button** as well as a **reagent link button**.

Craftable reagents inherit the match ranking of the crafts they're used for, recursively, and are listed directly after them. This is especially useful for Engineering which has lots of sub-crafts. Example in the image below: Heavy Blasting Powder doesn't match the hedyn filter but inherits the ranking of Heavy Dynamite.

### Link button functionality
**\<Left Click>** Link the mats for the selected craft to party or /r if not in a party.

**\<Right Click>** Open a popup for entering a character name or channel (g, guild, p, party, ra, bg etc.) to link to.

### Other
**\<Shift Click>** Copy chat names into the link popup editbox.
