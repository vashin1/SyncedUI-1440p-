# crafty - WoW 1.12 addOn 

Crafty adds a **fuzzy name search** to the default profession frames. Search results update on the fly and the first result (best match) is selected automatically.

Craftable reagents inherit the match ranking of the crafts they're used for, recursively, and are listed directly after them. This is especially useful for Engineering which has lots of sub-crafts. Example in the image below: Heavy Blasting Powder doesn't match the hedyn filter but inherits the ranking of Heavy Dynamite.

It also adds an **material filter button** as well as a **reagent link button**.

### Link button functionality
**\<Left Click>** Link the mats for the selected craft to party or /r if not in a party.

**\<Right Click>** Open a popup for entering a character name or channel (g, guild, p, party, ra, bg etc.) to link to.

## Favorites
**\<Right Click>** On skills adds them to or removes them from your favorites. If the favorites aren't empty they are displayed instead of the complete listing when no filter is applied.
To see the full listing when you have favorites hold down the ALT key.

### Other
**\<Shift Click>** Copy chat names into the link popup editbox.
