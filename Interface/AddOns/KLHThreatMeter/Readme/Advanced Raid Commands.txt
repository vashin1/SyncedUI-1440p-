R16: Some of this has been superceded by the GUI. There's a button for MasterTarget, enabled by default, and a button for Clearing the Raid Threat, disabled by default (click the options button then go to the raid tab, then click the checkbox to enable it).


So, you're a raid leader or officer in charge of the mod. How does it work?

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Step one is to work out how many people have the mod, or get everyone to upgrade to the latest version:


1) Check versions. Run the command

	/ktm version query

, or a suitable abbreviation, such as just
	
	/ktm v q


3) Now wait a few seconds, and the mod will print out something like

KTM: These people are using version 14: { Adam, Bob, }
KTM: These people are using version 13: { Cindy, Dave, }
KTM: These people are using older versions: { Edd, Frank, }
KTM: These people aren't using KLHThreatMeter: { Gill, Harry, }


4) Upgrade message. Run the command

	/ktm version notify

, or an abbreviation such as

	/ktm v n

. On people with older version, this will print out a message telling them to upgrade. However if their version is really old, it won't recognise the command, so you need to shout at the manually. Get all the people in the "using older versions" and "aren't using KLHThreatMeter" categories, and harrangue them until they install the mod.


--------------------------------------------------------------------

Step two is to set up a master target. It is often the case that in boss fights, there are a few adds present, or waves of weaker mobs that attack from time to time. It's most important to consider threat just towards the boss. If you set up a master target, then any damage and abilities against other mobs will not register on the meter. To do this,

1) Target the boss in question

2) Run the command

	/ktm mastertarget

, or a suitable abbreviation, e.g.

	/ktm mas

Everyone using the mod will see a message "The master target has been set to <Mob Name> by <Your Name>." You'll also see the mob's name in the label of the raid window when it is open.

3) When the fight is over, to clear the master target, run the command (with no target selected)

	/ktm mastertarget

, or 

	/ktm mas

and the mod will revert to its default state.

NOTE: Make sure you enable the master target on any tauntable boss. Taunt will only work properly when there is a master target.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Other stuff:

To clear everyone's threat, 

	/ktm resetraid

. This shouldn't usually be necessary; the mod should do this in most cases when it's needed.
