--> You only need to read on if you use a macro or mod that casts Sunder Armor. <--

The mod has a slight problem with Sunder Armor. The difficulty is that no message comes up in the combat log to tell when sunder has been cast. At present, the mod instead detects when you have pressed sunder armor from your action bars, then gives you a sunder. It then checks for sunder fail messages, e.g. "Your Sunder Armor was parried by x." or "not enough rage" messages, etc. If you are just using a sunder button, the mod will work fine, so stop reading!

The point is, the mod can't tell when you cast Sunder inside a macro. If you are using a macro to cast sunder, the mod will only be able to detect the events where sunder fails (e.g. is on the cooldown, or not enough rage, etc). As a result, your threat will be large and negative if you tend to spam the button. So you have to modify your macros slightly to tell the mod you are casting sunder. In general:

	/script CastSpellByName("Sunder Armor")
or
	/cast Sunder Armor

becomes

	/script KLHTM_Sunder()

e.g. suppose your macro was previously the following, to cast revenge, and if not sunder armor:

	/cast Revenge
	/cast Sunder Armor

the new version would be

	/cast Revenge
	/script KLHTM_Sunder()


Or suppose you used this macro to cast shield slam or sunder:

	/script if UnitMana("player") > 19 then CastSpellByName("Shield Slam") else CastSpellByName("Sunder Armor") end

The new macro would be

	/script if UnitMana("player") > 19 then CastSpellByName("Shield Slam") else KLHTM_Sunder() end
